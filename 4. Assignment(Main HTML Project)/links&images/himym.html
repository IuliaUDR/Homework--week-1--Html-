    <h1>How I Met Your Mother</h1>
    <img src="./himym.jpg">
    <p>Ted has fallen in love. It all started when his best friend, Marshall, drops the bombshell that 
        he plans to propose to longtime girlfriend Lily, a kindergarten teacher. Suddenly, Ted realizes 
        that he had better get a move on if he hopes to find true love. Helping him in the quest is Barney, 
        a friend with endless -- often outrageous -- opinions, a penchant for suits and a foolproof way to 
        meet women. When Ted meets Robin, he is sure it's love at first sight, but the affair fizzles into 
        friendship. Voice-over by Bob Saget ("Full House") tells the story through flashbacks.</p>
