    <h1>Two and A Half Men</h1>
    <img src="./two-and-a-half-men.jpg">
    <p>Chiropractor and single father Alan Harper lives in a beachfront house with divorced Internet 
        billionaire Walden Schmidt, who bought the house following the untimely death of Alan's brother, 
        Charlie. As they acclimate to their living arrangement, the tightly wound Alan finds himself taking 
        on a mentor role with Walden, whose lifelong dependence on being taken care of has left him a bit 
        naive. Despite his unsuccessful romantic history, Alan also tries to help Walden overcome his limited 
        experiences with dating. Berta, a sharp-tongued, unapologetic housekeeper, is also featured in the 
        series.
