    <title>My Favourite Sitcom</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Sitcomes I've enjoyed watching</h1>
    <p>During the week I love to spend my evenings with a little relaxing walk
     and a few episodes of my old favourite sitcomes, or discover new ones that
    might turn into favourites. <br/>
       Usually I prefer drama or thriller, but there are a few comedy shows that
    I would rewatch anytime and I loved watching them for the first time a few 
    years ago.</p>
